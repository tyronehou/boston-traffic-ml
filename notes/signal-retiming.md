## Terms
* cycle: Time needed for all phases
* phase: E.g. green, red, pedestrian, etc.
* offset: Difference in time between reference points across intersections
* split: time for a phase: sum of splits is a cycle

### Why signal retiming?
* Traffic can increase in an area in response to housing demands or other causes
* Reduce traffic delays at intersections and increase traffic flow smoothness

### Benefits/side effects of signal timing
* Can encourage platooning vehicles
* Incident management in conjunction with computerized system
* Reduce road rage and motorist frustration
* Reduce the number of sever collisions
* Reduce fuel consumption
* Eliminates/minimizes reconstruction of roads and infrastructure
* Dynamic adaptability to conditions for different times of day and days of the week

Cost/benefit ratio: 40:1

### How to signal retime
1. Collect geospatial data
2. Collect relevant traffic counts and pedestrian data. Preferably at 15 minute intervals. What happnes with daily counts are used??
3. Analyze Collision data (types, causation, remedies) This is used to determine the necessity and potential safety improvements of retiming
4. Create the model using Capacity analysis, traffic signal timing opt, simulation software. Existing timing is used
5. Signal coordination software is used (SYNCHRO, PASSER II).
6. Testing and adjustment phase
